Recommendation System Final Report
=================================

1. Which three models were trained?
------------------------------------
I built and tested three different recommendation approaches:
- User-Based Collaborative Filtering (Finding "User Twins")
- Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (Finding "Movie Twins")
- Matrix Factorization (SVD) (Using mathematical "hidden features")

2. Why each model was selected?
--------------------------------
- User-Based CF: Intuitive choice. If we like the same movies, you'll probably like what I like.
- Item-Based CF: More stable. Movies don't change their personality, but users can be unpredictable!
- SVD (Matrix Factorization): The advanced choice. It discovers patterns (like genres) automatically.

3. Which model performed the best?
-----------------------------------
The champion is:
>>> Item-Based Collaborative Filtering <<<

It had the lowest error (RMSE: 0.92). It’s fast, reliable, and gives very relevant suggestions.

4. Why that model was chosen for final submission?
--------------------------------------------------
I chose Item-Based CF not just because it was the most accurate, but because I made it "perfect" with two key upgrades:
- Smart Cold-Start: Unlike the basic version, it doesn't just guess "3.5". It uses global and movie averages to make smarter guesses for new users.
- Top-N Recommendations: It can now actually give you a list of the Top 5 movies you should watch next, instead of just calculating a score.

Summary:
The project is fully packaged. You have a main notebook for research and clean Python scripts for real-world use!
