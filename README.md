# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

An end-to-end Movie Recommendation System using **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering** on the [MovieLens Latest Small](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-latest-small) dataset.

This project demonstrates:

* Data preprocessing and EDA
* Training and comparing recommendation algorithms
* Saving reusable model artifacts
* Serving predictions via a **Streamlit dashboard**

> **Note:** The large model artifact files (`best_model.joblib`, `preprocessor.joblib`) are **not committed** to this repository due to size constraints. See [Model Artifacts](#-model-artifacts-important) for details.

## ✨ Features

* **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering** recommender
* Top‑N recommendations for any user in the dataset
* Single user–movie rating prediction
* Exploration of similar movies (based on rating patterns)
* Clean, multi-tab Streamlit UI:

  * Recommendations
  * Predict Rating
  * Similar Movies
* Modular inference (`inference.py`) separated from training logic

---

## 🧠 High-Level Approach

The system uses **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**:

1. Builds a **user–item rating matrix** from `ratings.csv`
2. Computes **movie–movie similarity** using cosine similarity:

   * Each movie is represented by its vector of user ratings
3. To predict a user’s rating for an unseen movie:

   * Looks at movies that the user has already rated
   * Weighs those ratings by similarity to the target movie
   * Computes a similarity‑weighted average
   * Falls back to the movie’s average rating or the global mean for cold‑start

The final deployed model is the **Item-Based CF** model (chosen based on RMSE/MAE).

**Expected but NOT tracked in this repo (see below):**

* `best_model.joblib`
* `preprocessor.joblib`
* 📊 Data (`ratings.csv`, `movies.csv`)

**Data Details:**

* `ratings.csv` – Columns: `userId`, `movieId`, `rating`, `timestamp`
  Used to build the user–item matrix and train/evaluate models.

* `movies.csv` – Columns: `movieId`, `title`, `genres`
  Used for displaying movie titles & genres in the UI.

Dataset source: **MovieLens Latest Small**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:**
  `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn` (cosine similarity, metrics), `joblib` (model persistence),
  `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (EDA/plots), `streamlit` (web dashboard)

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>
```

(Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # on Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # on macOS / Linux
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not provided, install manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib matplotlib seaborn streamlit
```

---

## 📦 Model Artifacts (Important)

The following files are **not included** in this GitHub repository because they are large binary artifacts:

* `best_model.joblib`
* `preprocessor.joblib`

These are generated by the training script and are required for inference and the Streamlit app.

---

## 🔍 Command-Line Inference

Test the core model logic via the command line:

```bash
python inference.py
```

This will:

* Load `preprocessor.joblib` and `best_model.joblib`
* Predict a sample rating for a given `(user_id, movie_id)`
* Print the Top‑5 recommendations for a sample user

**Key functions in `inference.py`:**

* `load_recommender()` – Loads preprocessor and model artifacts; computes `movie_averages` if needed.
* `predict_rating(user_id, movie_id, preprocessor, model)` – Predicts a rating for a specific user–movie pair.
* `get_recommendations(user_id, preprocessor, model, n=5)` – Returns Top‑N recommended movies as `(movieId, predicted_score)` pairs.

---

## 🌐 Streamlit Dashboard

The main user interface is built in `app.py`.

**Run the App:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local web server and display a URL (typically `http://localhost:8501`).

**App Features:**

### 📌 Recommendations

* Select a User ID
* Choose the number of recommendations (Top‑N)
* View a table of recommended movies with:

  * `movieId`, `title`, `genres`, Predicted rating
* Expand “Rating history for User X” to see what that user has already rated.

### ⭐ Predict Rating

* Select a User ID and a Movie Title
* Get the predicted rating (0.5 to 5.0) for that specific user–movie pair.

### 🎞 Similar Movies

* Select a reference movie
* View a list of movies most similar to it (according to rating patterns), with similarity scores, titles, and genres.

**Optional:** Custom theme via `.streamlit/config.toml`.

## 📈 Model Performance (From Training)

During training and evaluation (see `recommendation_system.py` or notebook):

* **Models Compared:**

  * User‑Based Collaborative Filtering
  * Item‑Based Collaborative Filtering
  * Matrix Factorization (SVD)

* **Best Performance:** Item‑Based Collaborative Filtering

  * RMSE ≈ 0.92
  * Chosen due to:

    * Good predictive accuracy
    * Stability
    * Interpretability (recommendations based on similar movies)
      
## Conclusion
This project delivers a complete movie recommendation system based on Item‑Based Collaborative Filtering using the MovieLens dataset. After comparing multiple approaches, the item‑based model was chosen for its strong accuracy and stability (RMSE ≈ 0.92). The final solution includes a reusable inference pipeline and a Streamlit dashboard, meeting the internship goals of building, evaluating, and deploying a practical, data‑driven recommendation system.
